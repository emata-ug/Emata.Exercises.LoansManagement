```

The project follows a modular monolith architecture where each business domain (Borrowers, Loans) is organized as an independent module with its own domain logic, data access, and presentation layers.

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 9.0** - Latest .NET framework
- **ASP.NET Core** - Web API framework
- **C#** - Primary programming language

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
- Git

### Building the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to project directory
cd Emata.Exercises.LoansManagement

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build
```

### Running the API

```bash
# Navigate to API project
cd src/Emata.Exercises.LoanManagement.API

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

**📋 For detailed testing information, see the [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md)**

## API Endpoints

The API will be available at `https://localhost:7xxx` when running locally. Check the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file for exact port numbers.

For interactive API documentation, navigate to `/scalar/v1` in your browser when running in development mode.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! To ensure consistency and quality, please follow these guidelines:

### Development Conventions

- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Adhere to the architectural patterns and coding conventions already established in the project
- **Modular Structure**: Organize code within the appropriate module (Borrowers, Loans, or Shared). If your feature doesn't fit into any existing module, consider creating a new module following the same structure
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow C# naming conventions and maintain consistency with existing code
- **Code Organization**: Keep domain logic in Domain folders, data access in Infrastructure, and HTTP endpoints in Presentation

### Testing Requirements

- **Integration Tests**: All new features and endpoints must include integration tests
- **Test Naming**: Follow the existing test naming conventions in the test project
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure your tests cover both success and failure scenarios
- **Use Existing Setup**: Leverage the existing test infrastructure and helpers (e.g., `WebApplicationFactory`, test fixtures)

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass by running `dotnet test`
2. Build the solution without errors using `dotnet build`
3. Verify your changes work as expected by running the API locally
4. Update documentation if you've added new features or changed existing behavior
